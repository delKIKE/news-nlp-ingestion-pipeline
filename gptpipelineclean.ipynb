            "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp37v4kyv3eo?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss\n",
            "Sir Keir Starmer has apologised to the victims of Jeffrey Epstein for believing Lord Mandelson's \"lies\" and appointing him as the UK's ambassador to the US. The prime minister began a planned speech on funding to improve local communities by addressing the growing anger over how he had dealt with the issue. While he acknowledged it had been publicly known for some time that Lord Mandelson knew Epstein, he said: \"None of us knew the depths and the darkness of that relationship.\" However, Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch said the PM's position was \"untenable\", while the Liberal Democrats called for a confidence vote to see if Labour MPs supported him. The prime minister is facing calls from some of his own MPs to stand down.  While the handful of backbenchers to do so publicly are frequent critics of the PM, many more have raised concerns privately. Sir Keir's former political director Luke Sullivan said he thought the PM was \"fighting for his premiership\". He told the BBC's Newscast: \"I don't think you can understate how serious the situation and the peril is that the prime minister finds himself in.\" Seeking to defuse the row in a speech earlier, Sir Keir said he regretted appointing Lord Mandelson and would not have done so if he had known what he knows now. Directly addressing Epstein's victims, he said:  \"I am sorry, sorry for what was done to you, sorry that so many people with power failed you. Sorry for having believed Mandelson's lies and appointed him and sorry that even now you're forced to watch this story unfold in public once again.\" Reacting to Sir Keir's apology, Epstein survivor Marina Lacerda said: \"I have to commend him for going on national television and admitting he was wrong and apologising to us.\" Speaking to the BBC's Newsnight, she said: \"I think that's a huge step, right. You have also people here in America that have not even tried to apologise to us.  \"So I have to commend him for that.\" Sir Keir has promised to release files, which he says will prove Lord Mandelson lied about the extent of his friendship with Epstein when he was being vetted for the US ambassador role. The government was forced into a climbdown by Labour backbenchers, after it had planned to withhold some sensitive material.  After a Commons vote, the government will pass documents which could damage national security or diplomatic relations to Parliament's Intelligence and Security Committee (ISC), rather than withholding them. The ISC says the government should decide which documents are made public - and which are not. They say this will be done by the cabinet secretary, with an expectation the documents are laid before parliament \"very shortly\". At the time Lord Mandelson was appointed as US ambassador in December 2024, it was public knowledge that he had maintained a friendship with Epstein after his conviction for soliciting sex from a minor. In 2023, the Financial Times reported emails suggesting he stayed at Epstein's Manhattan mansion in 2009, while the financier was in jail. The PM said Lord Mandelson was asked directly about the nature of his relationship with Epstein before he was appointed as ambassador, whether he had stayed at his home after his conviction and whether he had accepted gifts and hospitality from him. \"The information now available makes clear that the answers he gave were lies,\" he said. \"He portrayed Epstein as someone he barely knew. \"And when that became clear and it was not true, I sacked him.\" The BBC understands Lord Mandelson's view is that he answered questions about his relationship with Epstein in the vetting process accurately. Challenged after his speech over whether he should stand down as PM, Sir Keir said he understood the \"anger and frustration amongst Labour MPs\" over Lord Mandelson. However, he added: \"I was elected on a mandate in 2024 to change the country for the better... that's what I intend to do.\" Labour MP Rachael Maskell told BBC Radio York Sir Keir's position was \"untenable\" he had \"no choice\" but to step down. Meanwhile, Paula Barker, who represents Liverpool Wavertree, said the PM \"has shown that his judgement is questionable\". \"I think he has a very long way to build trust and confidence with public and trust and confidence within our party as a whole,\" she told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. Jonathan Hinder, the MP for Pendle and Clitheroe, said the PM's decision to appoint Lord Mandelson as US ambassador was a \"catastrophic error of political and moral judgement\". He called on Sir Keir to speak to Labour MPs in person and acknowledge this. Sir Keir has also faced calls to sack his chief of staff, Morgan McSweeney, who was close to Lord Mandelson and widely thought to have lobbied for his appointment. Karl Turner, Labour MP for Kingston upon Hull East, said the PM had been given \"shoddy\" advice over the appointment. He told the BBC he did not want a new prime minister but called on Sir Keir to \"get a grip\" and for McSweeney to go. Downing Street has insisted the PM has full confidence in his chief of staff. Lord Mandelson was sacked last September, following the emergence of new emails revealing supportive messages he sent to Epstein after he pleaded guilty to sex offences. In recent days, more documents released by the US Department of Justice have laid bare the extent of their relationship. They include emails suggesting Epstein made payments worth thousands of pounds to Lord Mandelson and his partner. Police are investigating allegations of misconduct in public office, after other emails in the files suggested Lord Mandelson forwarded on market-sensitive information to Epstein when he was business secretary during the financial crisis in 2009. Lord Mandelson has not responded to requests for comment, but the BBC understands his position is that he has not acted in any way criminally and that he was not motivated by financial gain.

His link to the convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein has led to a rethink at City Hall about the honour he received in 2018. Millions of Epstein-related documents released by the US justice department include the names of the world's rich and powerful.  Brad Karp’s company, Paul Weiss, previously said he did not participate in any misconduct. The PM is forced to back down over a plan to withhold some documents about the ex-minister's appointment as US ambassador.

            "Could this be the beginning of the end for Starmer?\n",
            "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c338g8n334mo?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss\n",
            "This is a very serious moment for Sir Keir Starmer. Everything the prime minister has said and done today has reflected the fact that he and his team understand the gravity of his situation. It would have felt odd and jarring had Sir Keir simply delivered the speech that he had been planning to deliver this morning about more funding to inspire pride in neighbourhoods. So he didn't.  The prime minister instead delivered an apology specifically to the victims of Jeffrey Epstein for having \"believed Mandelson's lies\" and appointed him to the UK's top diplomatic posting. Arguably more telling was the moment when, under intense questioning from journalists, Sir Keir conceded that he understood the \"anger and frustration of Labour MPs\". It is Labour MPs who will determine the prime minister's fate and they are more furious than they have ever been during his leadership right now.  Labour MP Rachael Maskell, who has been a thorn in Sir Keir's side over welfare cuts, has said she thinks his position as prime minister is \"untenable\" and it is \"inevitable\" that he will have to stand down. She told BBC Radio York: \"I don't believe he's got a choice. \"He kept from the House [of Commons] for several months the fact that he knew of the associations between Peter Mandelson and Jeffrey Epstein at the point of appointment.\" This was a \"dishonourable thing to do\" to MPs, as well as Epstein's victims, she added. Another Labour MP, who did not want to be named, told BBC Radio 5 Live's Matt Chorley: \"I have to say, I don't see how he can carry on.\" \"It's been terminal for months,\" added another, \"but the patient has now stopped responding to treatment.\" A Labour minister said: \"The only thing that is certain is that the government is not in control of this and so it could go anywhere.\" Others Matt spoke to were more supportive of the PM, with Rugby MP John Slinger saying: \"Calm heads need to prevail. The PM has done the right thing here.\"  Steve Witherden told BBC Wales: \"At the very least, the prime minister's chief of staff, Mr [Morgan] McSweeney, clearly has to answer why he pushed for Mandelson's appointment despite details of his relationship with Epstein being publicly known.\" However, it is telling that for all the off the record anger, few MPs are calling for the prime minister to go in public.  The small handful who have so far are MPs who have never much supported his leadership. In fact, there are not even many MPs willing to call publicly for McSweeney to be sacked, something Sir Keir has resisted doing. That suggests that while the prime minister is weaker than ever, a challenge to his leadership is far from imminent. \"Realistically I don't think something can happen until post-Gorton\", one MP said, referring to the Gorton and Denton by-election on 26 February.  \"And then it might be too close to May,\" when elections are being held in Scotland, Wales and some English local authorities. A former minister said: \"I still think it is very unlikely anybody moves before May. But it is all moving very fast.\"  They added: \"I don't see how the PM recovers from the utter lapse in judgment in appointing Mandelson.\" A current minister said: \"He's done. It's just a question of when.\" Sign up for our Politics Essential newsletter to keep up with the inner workings of Westminster and beyond. Reform says residents' pay is not keeping pace with tax rises, but critics say the party's budget is unsustainable. Starmer is furious with Mandelson, and the mood among many Labour MPs is darkening, the BBC's political editor writes. The chaos of the parliamentary debate about the former Labour minister is just one sign of how quickly the mood in the party has soured this week. Sir Keir Starmer's decision to send Lord Mandelson to Washington a year ago gives this row political salience, the BBC's political editor writes. The council says it aims to not make any service cuts amid a tax hike. Copyright 2026 BBC. All rights reserved.

            "Trump backs Chagos handover deal, says No 10\n",
            "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5yx1wedww2o?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss\n",
            "The US has backed the UK's deal to hand over the Chagos Islands to Mauritius and lease back a key military base, Downing Street has told the BBC. On Thursday, Donald Trump signalled his approval for the move, describing Sir Keir Starmer's agreement as the \"best he could make\". It comes just a few weeks after the US president prompted fears in Whitehall that he would withdraw his support, after he branded the deal an \"act of great stupidity\". Trump's comments led to additional talks between officials to confirm continued American support for the agreement, which will impact the future of a joint UK-US airbase.  The deal, originally announced last year, would see the UK transfer sovereignty of the Chagos Islands while leasing back the joint military base on the largest island, Diego Garcia, for an initial 99 years. During a conversation on Thursday, the two leaders \"agreed on the importance\" of the deal to secure the base, Downing Street said. A spokeswoman said they agreed the UK and US would \"continue to work closely on the implementation of the deal\". In a post on his Truth Social platform earlier on Thursday, Trump wrote that his discussions with Sir Keir had been \"very productive\". He added: \"I understand that the deal Prime Minister Starmer has made, according to many, the best he could make.\" \"However, if the lease deal, sometime in the future, ever falls apart, or anyone threatens or endangers US operations and forces at our base, I retain the right to militarily secure and reinforce the American presence in Diego Garcia,\" he said. Asked about Trump's comments, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters: \"He spoke with Prime Minister Starmer directly, he understands Prime Minister Starmer's position - and he supports it.\" \"But as the president reiterated in that statement, of course, the United States reserves the right to protect our assets.\"  Warren Stephens, the US's ambassador to the UK, said while the \"ideal\" outcome would be for the UK not to transfer sovereignty of the Chagos Islands, it was the \"best deal on the table for successive UK governments\". Echoing the president, Stephens said the US \"retains the right to maintain and to reinforce our security interests on Diego Garcia if needed in the future\". The deal was originally announced last year, and had been endorsed by Trump and US officials. But last month the US president labelled it an \"act of total weakness\". He added in a post on Truth Social: \"The UK giving away extremely important land is an act of GREAT STUPIDITY, and is another in a very long line of National Security reasons why Greenland has to be acquired.\" Trump's criticism of the agreement came during an international row over his threats to take control of Greenland. At the time, Sir Keir accused Trump of making the comments to pressure the UK over its support for the sovereignty of the Danish territory.  The comments threw into doubt whether the US would continue to support the Chagos deal. At the time, Downing Street said it believed the US still supported it, despite the president's comments. Officials in London and Washington have since been involved in talks to determine whether US support for the agreement still stood. The BBC understands those talks, which included two direct phone calls between Starmer and Trump, have now been completed. A draft law to ratify the Chagos Islands deal is making its way through Parliament but has been delayed since the president's outburst last month. Sir Keir has insisted the deal is necessary to protect the continued operation of the base, amid previous attempts from Mauritius to dispute the legality of British sovereignty over the islands. The deal has been heavily criticised by the Conservatives and Reform UK, who argue it undermines national security because of Mauritius's ties to China. Conservative shadow foreign secretary, Dame Priti Patel, said Trump's statement \"recognises a critical weakness in the surrender deal\" about the lease arrangements. \"The Conservative Party's view is unchanged,\" she added.  \"We have led the fight against this appalling surrender and we will continue fighting it to the end.\"  It is rare for US presidents to publicly back candidates in foreign elections.  The steps to bolster Canada's auto industry come as Trump's tariffs strain the sector and threaten jobs. The expiration of New START means there are no limits on nuclear weapons between both countries for the first time since 1991. The price of the digital currency has dropped significantly despite President Donald Trump’s public support. As a treaty with Russia expires, the US president says he can get a better deal. Experts warn that could take years.  Copyright 2026 BBC. All rights reserved. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites. Read about our approach to external linking.  \n",

            "We had sex in a Chinese hotel, then found we had been broadcast to thousands\n",
            "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c62rexy9y3no?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss\n",
            "One night in 2023, Eric was scrolling on a social media channel he regularly browsed for porn. Seconds into a video, he froze. He realised the couple he was watching - entering the room, setting down their bags, and later, having sex - was himself and his girlfriend. Three weeks earlier, they had spent the night in a hotel in Shenzhen, southern China, unaware that they were not alone. Their most intimate moments had been captured by a camera hidden in their hotel room, and the footage made available to thousands of strangers who had logged in to the channel Eric himself used to access pornography. Eric (not his real name) was no longer just a consumer of China's spy-cam porn industry, but a victim. Warning: This story contains some offensive language So-called spy-cam porn has existed in China for at least a decade, despite the fact that producing and distributing porn is illegal in the country. But in the past couple of years the issue has become a regular talking point on social media, with people - particularly women - swapping tips on how to spot cameras as small as a pencil eraser. Some have even resorted to pitching tents inside hotel rooms to avoid being filmed. Last April, new government regulations attempted to stem this epidemic - requiring hotel owners to check regularly for hidden cameras. But the threat of being secretly filmed in the privacy of a hotel room has not gone away. The BBC World Service has found thousands of recent spy-cam videos filmed in hotel rooms and sold as porn, on multiple sites. Much of the material is advertised on the messaging and social media app Telegram. Over 18 months, I discovered six different websites and apps promoted on Telegram. Between them these claimed to operate more than 180 hotel-room spy-cams which were not just capturing, but livestreaming, hotel guests' activities. I monitored one of these websites regularly for seven months and found content captured by 54 different cameras, with about half operational at any one time. That means thousands of guests could have been filmed over that period, the BBC estimates, based on typical occupancy rates. Most are unlikely to know they have been captured on camera. Eric, from Hong Kong, began watching secretly filmed videos as a teenager, attracted by how \"raw\" the footage was. \"What drew me in is the fact that the people don't know they're being filmed,\" says Eric, now in his 30s. \"I think traditional porn feels very staged, very fake.\" But he experienced what it feels like to be at the opposite end of the supply chain when he found the video of himself and his girlfriend \"Emily\" - and he no longer finds gratification in this content. When he broke the news to Emily that their hotel stay had been filmed, edited into an hour-long clip, and uploaded to Telegram, she thought he was joking. But then she saw the footage for herself and was mortified. Emily was terrified the clip could have been seen by colleagues and family. The couple didn't talk to each other for weeks. So how does the industry - which exploits unsuspecting couples' intimate sexual acts for voyeuristic paying customers - work, and who is behind it? One of the most prominent spy-cam porn traders I came across was an agent known as \"AKA\". Posing as a consumer, I paid to access one of the livestreaming websites promoted by him - for a monthly fee of 450 Yuan ($65, £47). Once logged in, I had the option to choose between five different filming feeds, each showing several hotel rooms - visible as soon as a guest triggered the electricity supply by inserting their key card. It was also possible to rewind livestreams from the start, and download archived clips. On Telegram - banned in China but commonly used for illicit activity - AKA advertised these livestreams. One Telegram channel had as many as 10,000 members during the course of our investigation. Libraries of his edited livestream clips are also available on Telegram for a flat fee. I could see more than 6,000 videos in the archive, dating back to 2017. AKA's subscribers comment in Telegram's channel function, as they watch unsuspecting hotel guests - judging their appearance, gossiping about their conversations, and appraising their sexual performance. They celebrate when a couple starts having sex - and complain if they switch the lights off, shrouding them in darkness. Women are regularly described as \"sluts\", \"whores\" and \"bitches\". We managed to trace one of the spy-cams to a hotel room in Zhengzhou, central China, through piecing together several clues, from subscribers, social media users, and our own research. Researchers on the ground were able to access the room, and found the camera - lens pointed at the bed - hidden in the wall ventilation unit and wired into the building's electricity supply. A hidden-camera detector, widely sold online as a \"must-have\" for hotel guests, gave no warning they were being spied on. The team disabled the secret camera and word spread quickly on Telegram. \"Zhonghua [name of the camera] got taken down!\" one subscriber wrote on the main channel managed by AKA. \"It's such a shame; that room has the best sound quality!\" AKA responded in the chat. But the complaints turned to celebration when, within hours, AKA posted that a replacement camera in a different hotel had been activated. \"This is the speed of… [our livestreaming platform],\" AKA told his subscribers. \"Impressive right?\" During our 18-month investigation we identified about a dozen agents like AKA. The exchanges they had with subscribers made it clear they were working for others higher up the supply chain, who they referred to as \"camera owners\". These people, the agents' comments suggested, arranged the spy-cam installation and managed the livestreaming platforms. During our direct messaging with AKA, he accidentally shared a screenshot of a message from someone he said was a \"camera owner\", with the profile name \"Brother Chun\". AKA quickly deleted the message, and refused to discuss it, but we managed to contact \"Brother Chun\" directly. Despite our evidence that he supplied the livestreaming website to AKA, Brother Chun claimed he was just another sales agent, although he did seem to acknowledge the supply chain extended beyond people like himself. What is clear is there are significant sums of money to be made. Based on channel membership and subscription fees, the BBC estimates AKA alone has earned at least 163,200 Yuan ($22,000, £16,300) since last April. The average annual income in China last year was 43,377 Yuan ($6,200, £4,600) according to China's Bureau of Statistics. There are strict rules on selling and using spy-cams in China, but we found it relatively easy to buy one in the country's largest electronics market in Huaqiangbei. Accurate figures on how many people have been brought before the courts for spy-cam porn are more difficult to find. China's authorities have shared far fewer legal case details in recent years, but the cases we found ranged the length of China - from Jilin province in the north, to Guangdong in the far south. Blue Li, from a Hong Kong-based NGO called RainLily - which helps victims remove explicit secretly-filmed footage from the internet - says demand is rising for her group's services, but the task is proving more difficult. Telegram never responds to RainLily's requests for removal, she says, forcing them to contact group administrators - the very people selling or sharing spy-cam pornography - who have little incentive to respond. \"We believe tech companies share the huge responsibility in addressing these problems. Because these companies are not neutral platforms; their policies shape how the content would be spread,\" Li says. The BBC itself told Telegram, via its report function, that AKA and Brother Chun - and the groups they managed - were sharing spy-cam porn via its platforms, but it did not respond or take any action. Contacted again 10 days later, with the BBC's full investigation findings, Telegram told us: \"Sharing non-consensual pornography is explicitly forbidden by Telegram's terms of service\" and \"it proactively moderates… and accepts reports [of inappropriate content] in order to remove millions of pieces of harmful content each day.\" We formally set out our findings to Brother Chun and AKA that they were profiting from exploiting unsuspecting hotel guests. They did not reply, but hours later the Telegram accounts they used to advertise the content appeared to have been deleted. However the website that AKA sold me access to is still livestreaming hotel guests. Eric and Emily remain traumatised by their experience. They always wear hats in public in case they are recognised and try to avoid staying in hotels. Eric no longer uses these Telegram channels to watch porn, he says, but still checks them occasionally - terrified the clip could resurface. Additional reporting by Cate Brown, Bridget Wing and Mengyu Dong As school holidays approach, some hotels are offering full-day, structured kids' camps that allow parents to travel, work and keep routines intact. The UK's largest porn site has blocked unregistered users from accessing explicit content in the country, but why motives remain unclear. The changes mean only those who have a Pornhub account and have verified their age will be able to access it in the UK soon. Restaurateurs on Tyneside warn hospitality venues are \"on their last legs\" amid a spate of closures. The Blackaddie House Hotel in Sanquhar dates back to the 16th Century and ran as a hotel for decades. Copyright 2026 BBC. All rights reserved.

            "Number of homeless refugees in England soars, BBC finds\n",
            "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy9y3n43192o?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss\n",
            "There has been a five-fold increase in the number of refugee households who are homeless or at risk of homelessness in the last four years, the BBC has found. Government data for England showed a rise from 3,560 in 2021/22, to 19,310 in 2024/25. Charities said the increase was a \"direct result\" of government policy, and blamed the 28-day period newly-recognised refugees are given to move out of Home Office accommodation - including hotels - as well as faster processing of claims by asylum seekers. The government said it was \"committed\" to helping refugees transition from asylum housing to their own accommodation and was working with local authorities \"to mitigate the risk of homelessness\". It comes as successive governments have struggled to get a grip on the UK's overwhelmed asylum system, with a huge backlog of people waiting for decisions on claims and appeals. Processing had been slow and, at one point put on pause entirely, but Labour wants to speed up decisions - resulting in more people being granted refugee status and looking for somewhere to live. One charity supporting homeless refugees said it was mostly seeing young women under the age of 30 asking for help. Yusra, who arrived in the UK on a small boat after fleeing war in Sudan, is among them. The 26-year-old said her entire family was killed before she arrived in the UK. She was placed in a government-funded asylum hotel for about five months but said, since she was granted refugee status in late August, she had been sleeping in a tent on the streets of Greater Manchester. \"Sometimes drunk people come and try to open the tent and I start screaming,\" Yusra said. \"I can't sleep until the morning.\" In the days before she had to leave her Home Office accommodation, Yusra contacted her local council. However, as a single adult without children, she ranked as low priority for social housing. Yusra told the BBC she fled Sudan for a better life but now regretted coming to the UK, saying life has been \"very difficult\" since becoming homeless. She is one of many refugees receiving support from the Stockport Race Equality Partnership. Once an asylum seeker is given refugee status they have 28 days to move out of government-funded accommodation - usually a house in multiple occupation (HMO) or a hotel - and find their own housing. At the same time, they must find work or, if necessary, apply for universal credit. The government has said it usually takes about 35 days to receive an initial universal credit payment. As a result, charities have said many refugees are not able to secure housing or benefits before their asylum support ends. Jasmine Basran, Head of Policy & Campaigns for national homelessness charity Crisis, said 28 days was not enough time for refugees to sort everything. She said the charity was seeing the highest rise in homelessness among refugees and the true number without a home was likely to be even higher, as government data only counts those who notify their local authority. According to the latest figures, London and the North West - including Manchester and Liverpool - have the highest proportion of refugees who are homeless or at risk of homelessness. The west London borough of Hillingdon saw the sharpest increase - 2,098 homeless households in the area were refugees in 2024/25, up from 71 in 2021/22. Refugees must seek support from an area they have a local connection to, which is often where their asylum accommodation is. Hillingdon houses a higher number of asylum seekers due to its proximity to Heathrow Airport. In December, the National Audit Office released a damning report into the asylum system, finding a succession of \"short-term, reactive\" government policies had moved problems elsewhere, increasing levels of homelessness. Its criticisms highlighted changes to the 28-day move-on period, a drive to clear inherited asylum backlogs shifting pressure onto appeals, and a shortage of judges creating court backlogs. Last year, the Labour government ran a pilot increasing the 28-day period for people granted asylum to 56 days, but this ended early, in September, when it reverted back to 28 days. In 2023, for some refugees, that period shrunk to seven days after the government briefly changed how the move-on period was calculated. The policy was reversed, with the British Red Cross saying it had led to \"devastating levels of destitution\". The 56 day move-on period pilot was, however, extended for those deemed vulnerable - including pregnant women, families with children and disabled people. It was due to end in January 2026, but is understood to still be in place. It comes as the latest Home Office figures suggest 110,000 people claimed asylum in the year ending September 2025 - a 13% increase on the previous year. As of September last year, there were 108,085 people in asylum accommodation, with more than 36,000 in hotels and the majority in shared housing, such as HMOs. Asylum accommodation contracts have cost the government billions of pounds. The government has pledged to clear the backlog of asylum seekers waiting for their claim to be decided, to close \"every asylum hotel\" and cut asylum costs, adding that \"more suitable\" sites were being brought forward to \"ease pressure on communities\". But Jacqui Broadhead, director of the Global Exchange on Migration and Diversity at the University of Oxford, said a \"long-term reimagining\" of asylum policies may be required. She suggested one solution was to invest in more temporary accommodation instead of paying private providers to oversee asylum accommodation sites such as hotels. After initially being used to help the asylum backlog, she said it could aid the housing shortage more generally. She highlighted the importance of co-ordination between local authorities and the Home Office, adding that increased and faster decision-making on asylum claims can \"put very high levels of pressure\" on housing services that are already \"extremely stretched\".

            "Statin pills much safer than advertised, major review finds\n",
            "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c80142p2g00o?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss\n",
            "Cholesterol-lowering drugs called statins, used by millions, are far safer than previously thought, a major review has found.  Leaflets in packs should be changed to reflect this and avoid scaring people off using the life-saving pills, say the authors.  Statins do not cause the majority of the possible side effects listed, including memory loss, depression, sleep disturbance, weight gain and impotence, says the team funded by the British Heart Foundation. Meanwhile, they can slash a person's risk of heart attacks and strokes.  The results, in The Lancet journal, come from trials involving more than 120,000 people comparing statins with a dummy drug or placebo.  Statins are highly effective at lowering \"bad\" LDL cholesterol levels and have been repeatedly proven to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease - a condition that causes some 10 million deaths worldwide and a quarter of all deaths in the UK, say the researchers from Oxford University.  As with any medicine, there can be side effects, but these are few. Reports of adverse effects were almost identical in the placebo group that was not on the medication, suggesting statins are not the cause.  None of the patients in the trials knew if the pill they were taking was real or a pretend one. In the review, only four side-effects out of 66 listed were found to have any association with taking statins, and only in a very small proportion of patients. The four were: There was no increase in liver disease such as hepatitis or liver failure, suggesting that the liver blood test changes did not lead to more serious liver problems. Statin therapy can sometimes cause muscle damage, but this is rare. They can also cause a small increase in blood sugar levels which might bring on diabetes sooner in people who are susceptible. Again, this is rare.  Lead author Prof Christina Reith said worries about statin safety had deterred many people who could benefit from taking them. \"Ongoing confusion and concern about side effects mean many people are not willing to start them or stop them. This is a major issue.\"  That's not to say people do not experience things while on them,\" she added, \"but we now have really good evidence that statins are not the cause of common problems. \"Our study provides reassurance that, for most people, the risk of side effects is greatly outweighed by the benefits.\" Her colleague Prof Sir Rory Collins, who is the review's senior author, said: \"Now that we know that statins do not cause the majority of side effects listed in package leaflets, statin information requires rapid revision to help patients and doctors make better-informed health decisions.\" Prof Bryan Williams, from the British Heart Foundation, suggested many people were missing out on statins due to stories around unproven possible side effects. \"Prescribers have been intoxicated by this negative publicity.  \"We are absolutely delighted to see the outcomes of this study. These findings should provide very powerful reassurance,\" Prof Williams said. Experts stress statins save lives, but if you have any problem with your medication you should chat with your doctor.

            "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn40ev200yjo?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss\n",
            "The crown of French Empress Eugenie was left crushed after being dropped by fleeing thieves during the raid at the Louvre last October - but is \"nearly intact\" and can be fully restored, the museum has said. Raiders stole an estimated 88 million euros (£76m, $104m) in jewels, but left the diamond-studded headpiece belonging to the wife of Napoleon III on their escape route. The museum has issued the first photographs of the crown since the theft, saying it had been left \"badly deformed\" after the thieves tried to remove it through a narrow hole they sawed in its glass display case. The crown is missing one of eight golden eagles that adorned it but retains its 56 emeralds and all but 10 of its 1,354 diamonds. It added the 19th Century crown would be restored to its original state \"without the need for reconstruction\". An expert committee led by the museum's president Laurence des Cars had been selected to supervise the restoration. The heist took place on 19 October and saw the gang use a stolen vehicle-mounted mechanical lift to gain access to the Galerie d'Apollon (Gallery of Apollo) via a balcony close to the River Seine.  Two of the thieves got inside by cutting through the window with power tools. They then threatened the guards, who evacuated the area, and cut through the glass of two display cases housing jewellery that once belonged to French royalty or its imperial rulers. Prosecutors said the thieves were inside for less than four minutes before making their escape on two scooters waiting outside. Police have arrested four male suspects who prosecutors allege are the thieves - but the mastermind behind the raid has not been tracked down.  The seven other items of jewellery taken, including a diamond-studded tiara that belonged to Eugenie and necklaces, ear-rings and brooches remain missing. Experts at Christie's say it is a foot sketch of the Libyan Sibyl, which was later painted on the Sistine Chapel ceiling. Worcester City Council investigates  whether the artwork is against advertising and planning rules. Organiser Moving Parts Arts says it will try again for funding in 2027. The artist who painted the cherub has admitted it was Giorgia Meloni's face, as the Rome church sees a steady flow of curious visitors.

            "US and Iran talks to begin as fears of direct conflict continue\n",
            "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cr57g1y8286o?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss\n",
            "Senior US and Iranian officials are expected to meet in Oman later for direct talks amid a crisis that has raised fears of a military confrontation between the two countries. The discussions come after a US military build-up in the Middle East in response to Iran's violent repression of nationwide anti-government protests last month, that human rights groups say killed many thousands of people. Uncertainty over the location and scope had threatened to derail the talks, which are part of a diplomatic effort by regional mediators to de-escalate tensions. Both countries remain far apart in their positions. The hope is that, if successful, the discussions could lead to a framework for negotiations. The US, which is demanding Iran freezes its nuclear programme and discards its stockpile of enriched uranium, had said the talks should also involve Iran's ballistic missiles, the country's support for regional armed groups and its treatment of its citizens.  Iran, however, has said the discussions will be limited to its nuclear programme, and it is unclear if these differences have been resolved. In recent weeks, President Donald Trump has threatened to bomb Iran if it does not reach a deal. The US has sent thousands of troops and what Trump has described as an \"armada\" to the region, including an aircraft carrier along with other warships as well as fighter jets.  Iran has vowed to respond to an attack with force, threatening to strike American military assets in the Middle East and Israel. The Iranian delegation will be led by Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi, who last week said his country's armed forces were \"with their fingers on the trigger\", while the US will be represented by special envoy Steve Witkoff and Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner.  This will be the first meeting involving US and Iranian officials since the war between Israel and Iran last June, when the US bombed Iran's three main nuclear facilities.  Iran says its uranium enrichment activity stopped after the attacks. For Iran's embattled leaders, the talks could be the last chance to avert US military action that could further destabilise the regime, which analysts say is in its weakest position since it came to power following the 1979 Islamic Revolution. Trump's threats came as Iran's security forces brutally repressed large-scale demonstrations, which were triggered by a deepening economic crisis, and saw protesters calling for the end of the Islamic Republic.  The Human Rights Activists News Agency, a Washington-based group, said it had confirmed at least 6,883 deaths, warning that the number could be much higher, and that more than 50,000 people had been arrested. The current crisis has brought back to discussions the issue of Iran's nuclear programme, which has been at the centre of a long-running dispute with the West.  For decades, Iran has said its programme is for peaceful purposes, while the US and Israel have accused it of being part of an effort to develop a weapon. Iran says it has the right to enrich uranium in its own territory and has rejected calls for its stockpile of highly enriched uranium - 400kg (880lb) - to be transferred to a third country.  Officials have indicated being open to concessions, which could include the creation of a regional consortium for uranium enrichment, as proposed during talks with the US that collapsed when Israel launched its surprise war last year. At the same time, Iran says demands to limit the country's ballistic missile programme and to end the support for proxies in the region - an alliance Tehran calls the \"Axis of Resistance\" that includes Hamas in Gaza, militias in Iraq, Hezbollah in Lebanon and the Houthis in Yemen - are unacceptable and a breach of its sovereignty. On Tuesday, Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian said he had instructed Araghchi to \"pursue fair and equitable negotiations\" with the US, \"provided that a suitable environment exists\".  In any case, Iran is expected to demand the lifting of sanctions that have crippled its economy. Opponents of the regime say any relief would give the clerical rulers a lifeline. For the US, the meeting, depending on its outcome, could offer an offramp for Trump from his military threats.  Regional countries are concerned that a US strike could lead to a wider conflict or long-term chaos in Iran, and have warned that air power alone will not be able to topple the Iranian leadership. Asked if Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei should be worried, Trump told NBC News on Wednesday: \"I would say he should be very worried. Yeah, he should be\". US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the discussions would have to go beyond the nuclear issue for \"something meaningful\" to be achieved.  \"I'm not sure you can reach a deal with these guys, but we're going to try to find out. We don't see there's any harm in trying to figure out if there's something that can be done,\" he said. The talks, initially planned to be held in Istanbul, are an effort led by Egypt, Turkey and Qatar to defuse tensions.  Iran, however, asked at the last minute for the location of the meeting to be changed to Oman, which hosted discussions last year, and for it to be limited to Iranian and American officials.

            "Jacob Elordi: I practised my Northern accent in the bath\n",
            "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c07xyp5rxl3o?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss\n",
            "Ever wondered how an actor from Brisbane, Australia, perfects a Northern accent? The answer may surprise you. \"I just practise it in the bath, over and over and over and over,\" said Jacob Elordi, who is starring as Heathcliffe in the hotly anticipated new film Wuthering Heights, set on the tempestuous Yorkshire moors. \"I like the meks and the teks, instead of take. I like the M-E-K, T-E-K,\" he said, spelling the words out. Elordi, 28, is starring opposite fellow Aussie actor Margot Robbie in Emerald Fennell's new take on Emily Brontë’s classic novel. Before the film has even come out, it has sparked some controversy over its casting as well as its apparent BDSM-inspired scenes. But there's also been a huge build-up for the film, and at the premiere in rainy central London on Thursday night, scores of screaming fans turned out for a glimpse of two of the hottest stars on the planet. Leicester Square had been decked out to resemble the wilds of Yorkshire, and the red carpet was actually charcoal black, to fit the gothic vibe of the film. Brat singer Charli XCX was also among the stars braving the drizzle. The 33-year-old, whose real name is Charlotte Emma Aitchison, has written an album for the upcoming film, with tracks including Chains Of Love, Wall Of Sound and House. When speaking to BBC News, Charli peered out from under a pale, pink veil which formed part of a striking bridal ensemble. \"Sorry, I can barely see you,\" she admitted. But when asked how she'd found the transition from the lime green, Brat summer vibe of her award-winning album to the darker themes of this film, she lit up. \"Honestly, [it was] really, really fun. I always like to work in polar opposites. And so this was, honestly, a dream project to me,\" she said. \"When I first started making music, I was so inspired by so many of the references that Emerald and I were talking about, Shakespeares Sister to The Cure, to obviously Kate Bush,\" she said (singer-songwriter Bush famously wrote her debut single, Wuthering Heights, as a teenager in the 1970s). \"So yeah, this was really heavenly to work on.\" The singer is also starring in the satirical film The Moment, which revisits the cultural phenomenon that followed the release of her 2024 album. But she indicated that she was very ready to say goodbye to Brat summer. \"Yes. Let's put it in the ground. I'm ready.\" Barbie star Robbie, who plays Cathy, dazzled fans on Thursday turning up in a striking, corseted Gothic gown with a matching choker. She also wore a replica of Charlotte Brontë's bracelet. She told BBC News the original was believed to have been woven out of the hair of Charlotte's sisters: Emily and Anne. The actress, who is also a producer on the new film, is well known for method dressing, having dressed as the famous plastic doll for her press appearances back in 2023. There has been a lot of interest in the relationship between Robbie and Elordi. The pair seem to have closely bonded while filming, and even have matching signet rings - although some have dismissed their closeness as a marketing stunt. Elordi even confirmed the reports that he'd left flowers in his co-star's dressing room on Valentine's Day, telling the BBC emphatically: \"Yes.\" When asked whether it was the Australian connection that brought them closer, Robbie agreed. \"Yeah, it was certainly nice to work with someone who's from somewhere so close to where I'm from,\" she said. But she added everyone on set \"really bonded on this job\". \"I think we were all so excited to be executing [Fennell's] vision, and she really gives you the space to feel safe, but really go for it. And everyone really went for it.\" The film is written, directed and produced by Fennell, who won an Oscar for her breakthrough film Promising Young Woman in 2021. Her last feature Saltburn - also starring Elordi - gained viral notoriety for its salacious scenes (including that bathtub scene). Audience reaction at the test screenings for Wuthering Heights was mixed, with much talk of a shocking opening scene of a public hanging in which the \"condemned man ejaculates mid-execution\". But first reactions to the film on social media have been overwhelmingly positive, with film writer Anne Thompson calling it \"a rip-roaring, bodice-ripping crowd-pleaser\" and critic Courtney Howard saying it \"expertly captures the breathtaking ache and essence of desire\". When asked about the provocative nature of the film, Robbie said she thought people \"might be a little surprised\" by how emotional it actually is. \"I know there's been a lot of talk about it being provocative, but I think it's emotional more than anything. It's very romantic. It's very epic. It's like large scale filmmaking, very cinematic.\" Set in the 18th Century, Wuthering Heights is a story of desire, obsession and revenge, following the affair between the wild Catherine Earnshaw and the dashing Heathcliff. It may be one of the most enduring - and tragic - love stories ever written, but when Robbie and Elordi's casting was announced, many film fans were left unimpressed. Some pointed out that Catherine is in her teens in the book, unlike Robbie who is 35. Meanwhile Heathcliff is described in the novel, written in 1847, as \"dark-skinned\", although his ancestry is ambiguous. But Fennell has previously defended the decision to cast Elordi, telling the Hollywood Reporter that it was her own take on the story. \"The great thing about this movie is that it could be made every year and it would still be so moving and so interesting,\" she added. \"There are so many different takes. I think every year we should have a new one.\" The novel has been adapted for the screen numerous times. The last film came out in 2011 and was made by director Andrea Arnold, starring Skins actress Kaya Scodelario as Catherine and James Howson as Heathcliff. Juliette Binoche and Ralph Fiennes appeared in a 1992 version. On TV in 2009, ITV cast Tom Hardy as Heathcliff and Charlotte Riley as his doomed love interest. The new film also stars Adolescence’s Owen Cooper as a young Heathcliff, as well as Alison Oliver, Hong Chau, Shazad Latif, Martin Clunes, and Ewan Mitchell in supporting roles. Wuthering Heights is released in UK cinemas on 13 February. BBC Verify looks into the numbers. The Crown star has quit caffeine due to the bug which she thinks she caught in Morocco. Gaynor Faye says Hot Flash uses humour to make the menopause 'understandable and digestible'. Concerns were raised by a subcommittee including potential price rises and the future of cinemas.

            "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy7mrj5k2kdo?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss\n",
            "A 15-year-old boy has been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a teacher was injured at a school.  Dyfed-Powys Police said officers were called to Milford Haven Comprehensive School in Pembrokeshire at about 15:20 GMT on Thursday.  Supt Chris Neve said they were responding to reports of the assault of a teacher by a pupil brandishing a weapon. \"The teacher's injury is not a stab injury. A lockdown was implemented but has now been lifted,\" he said.  The teacher has since been discharged, police said. Wales First Minister Eluned Morgan said \"violence of any kind has no place in our schools\".  \"All pupils at the location were safe, and all returned home unharmed,\" said Supt Neve. He added that police had left the school, and that the 15-year-old boy was in police custody.  \"Parents and guardians will continue to receive any future updates directly through the school app. \"You will see a higher than usual police presence in the area over the coming days – these will be dedicated patrols to provide further reassurance to those living in and attending school in the area,\" he added. John Harvey, leader of Pembrokeshire council, thanked staff and pupils for \"implementing a swift and effective lockdown\". He added that the school would be closed on Friday, but that help would be available for those requiring additional support. After school events were cancelled on Thursday. A Welsh Ambulance Service spokesperson said they were called to the scene on Thursday afternoon and one patient was transported to hospital. Morgan, who visited the school last week, said her thoughts were with the injured teacher, their family and the entire school community, adding her government would support all those affected. Mid and South Pembrokeshire MP Henry Tufnell said he was \"very grateful to the school staff and our emergency services for their swift response in ensuring the safety of pupils and colleagues\". He described the local area as a \"really close community\". Following the incident, Matt Wrack, the general secretary of the NASUWT teachers' union, said schools \"should be places of safety and learning - not fear and violence\".  \"We will be standing by to offer all the support we can,\" he said.

The figure rose from 3,560 in 2021/22 to 19,310 in 2024/25. Charities believe this increase is a direct result of government policy, including the 28-day period that new refugees are given to find new accommodations after leaving Home Office accommodation. The government states it's committed to helping refugees transition from asylum housing to their own accommodations. However, processing of asylum applications has been slow, leading to increased numbers of people being granted refugee status and needing somewhere to live, exacerbating the homelessness problem. Critics suggest a long-term reimagining of asylum\n",

            "Summary: Cholesterol-lowering drugs called statins are safer than previously thought, according to a review funded by the British Heart Foundation. The study found that the drugs do not cause the majority of potential side effects listed, such as memory loss, depression, and weight gain, and can significantly reduce the risk of heart attacks and strokes. Out of the 66 potential side effects listed, only four were found to have any association with taking statins. The study, based on trials involving more than 120,000 people, was published in The Lancet journal. Researchers suggested that the information about statins should be revised to prevent inaccuracies from deterring people from taking the medication.\n",

            "Summary: The crown of French Empress Eugenie, crushed during a raid at the Louvre last October, can be fully restored, according to the museum. Thieves stole an estimated 88 million euros in jewels, abandoning the diamond-studded headpiece during their escape. The 19th-century crown was left \"badly deformed\" after the thieves attempted to extract it through a small hole they had sawed in the glass case. The crown will be restored to its original state \"without the need for reconstruction\", under a committee supervised by the museum's president, Laurence des Cars. Seven other items, including a diamond tiara, remain missing.\n",

            "Summary: US and Iranian officials will meet in Oman to discuss the ongoing crisis between both countries, which has raised concern over potential military clashes. The meeting was arranged following Iran's suppression of anti-government protests and the US's military build-up in the Middle East. The key points of contention focus on Iran's nuclear programme, support for armed groups, ballistic missiles, and treatment of citizens. However, Iran wants the talks to solely address its nuclear programme. The Trump administration has deployed military forces to the region, threatening to bomb Iran if no deal is reached. Thousands of troops, an aircraft carrier, other warships, and fighter jets have been sent. Iran has also threatened to respond forcefully if attacked.\n",
